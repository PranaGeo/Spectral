#Spectral

Spectral is an R package providing a new data type for R that stores spectral, temporal and spatial attributes of measurement data as well as methods for accessing and manipulating the spectral (and non-spectral) data. Once spectral data is imported into Spectral, the statistical and data processing power of R is available for various kinds of scientific analyses.

It provides the following S4 classes:
* Spectra class (stores spatial/temporal/spectral aspects of data)
* SpcHeader class (stores metadata in an R list object)
* SpcList class (makes a collection of Spectra objects in an R list)

and basic data access and manipulation methods for scientific data:

+ importing 
+ acessing and subsetting
+ converting into R objects
+ analyzing
+ plotting
+ exporting
