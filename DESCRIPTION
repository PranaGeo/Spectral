Description: This package provides S4 classes and basic manipulation methods for datasets 
		frequently used in remote sensing, bio-optical oceanography and environmental and 
		earth sciences. The package is based on the basic data type called Biooo which was
		concieved for non-spectral data that can easily be represented with a data.frame. 
		Several other classes extend Bioo to store spatial/temporal and spectral aspects 
		of Bio-Optical data that are regularly collected during Bio-Optical oceanography
		campaigns.
